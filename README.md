# kanidm-builder

This is very very very very very early work on trying to make some standard build tools for kanidm to make releases I can use and probably even distribute.

Set the rust build version in `RUST_VERSION`.

This requires docker-compose and runs on operating systems with bash. Has been tested on Windows 10 WSL2 (ubuntu 20.04).

Usage:

 1. clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/yaleman/kanidm-builder.git`
 2. run the thing `./build_in_docker.sh`
